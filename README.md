I designed and developed a custom personal portfolio website for Shijin Varghese, fully aligned with the client’s vision and requirements.
The project prioritizes content, cultural identity, and narrative over contemporary UI trends, as per the client’s preference.
The site features customized layouts, mobile responsiveness, and structured content highlighting his social service journey and national contributions.
I also handled full deployment using a custom domain, making this a complete end-to-end real-world project.
Further feature enhancements are planned.
